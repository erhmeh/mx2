If you dont know how to use git then please dont touch.

Always double check before you push to master and write what you have changed in the description section.

If you want to go crazy and it might fuck everything up, please take a branch.

Other than the assignment code, most stuff will be Jamin's, if you want to upload your code, put it in a subfolder somewhere appropriate.
